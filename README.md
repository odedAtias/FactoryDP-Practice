# Factory Design Pattern - Practice

🔹This program will implement drawing operations on shapes under the Design Factoy pattern.

🔹The purpose of the program is to learn to work under the Factory Design pattern and to understand how to implement it.

🔹In many situations we inhale to create object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface, 
and that's exactly what Factory design pattern promises us

## 👨‍💻 Technologies

👉 Java Programming language

## Implementation Remarks

🔹 The program is divided into 4 main parts: 

* An interface that defines the draw operation.
* Concrete classes implementing the same interface, in other words our shapes. 
* Factory Class to generate object of concrete class based on given information.
* Main - our demo class, to get object of concrete class by passing an information such as type (Passed in string format).
